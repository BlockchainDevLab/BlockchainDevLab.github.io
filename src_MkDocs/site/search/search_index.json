In this lab, the learning objective is for students to have a hands-on experience and in-depth understanding of Blockchain's  transactional interface. In addition, writing a transaction in Blockchain goes throug mining. This lab also introduces the basic concept of mining. The module consists several exercises and the details are found in  [\nBlockchain storage lab\n].\n\n\nRecommended Time\n\n\n\n\nSupervised situation (e.g. a closely-guided lab session): \n1 hour\n\n\nUnsupervised situation (e.g. take a home lab): \n1 week\n\n\n\n\nFiles that are needed\n\n\n\n\nYou will need the [\ngenesis.json\n] file to execute this lab successfully.",
